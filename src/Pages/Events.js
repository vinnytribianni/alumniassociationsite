            <h2>Annual Dart Tournament</h2>
            <p><b>About</b></p>
            <p>Once a year since 1992, the Alumni Brothers of Alpha Rho of Chi Psi have gathered for the purposes of fellowship and gentlemanly competition at their beloved game of darts.  With nearly one hundred Brothers attending each year, the tournament has become an annual homecoming for numerous Brothers and a spirited competition for those who have loved the game of darts since their undergraduate days at the Lodge.</p>
            <p>Listed below are the all-time Champions dating back to 1992 when the 1st Annual Tournament was held at the home of Brother Seamus Dolan, P 1986.  Details for each year's Tournament including a recap and individual and team statistics are available by selecting the respective year below.</p>
            <p>The Brothers of Alpha Rho are indebted to Brother Brendan Dolan, P 1986, for his leadership and contributions in coordinating numerous Tournaments over the years, maintaining detailed statistics of individual and team scores and providing much-anticipated recaps following each year's Tournament. </p>
            <p>Brother Dolan has also maintained individual and team records dating back to the 1st Annual Tournament in 1992.  A full listing of these records is available via the link below.</p>

            <h2>Annual Scramble Golf Tournament</h2>
            <p><b>About</b></p>
            <p>A new and exciting tradition has begun at Alpha Rho following the inaugural Rho Scramble golf tournament held on April 26th, 2024. Brothers old and young gathered together at the Rutgers University golf course for a day filled with great weather, golf, beers, and fun. Nearly 100 brothers participated in the first annual tournament, making it a great success.</p>
            <p>This event was set up by the active brothers with alumni assistance. The actives of Alpha Rho are very appreciative of the support and generosity from the alumni.</p>
            <p>This is an event that the actives hope to repeat each year in the late spring, and we hope that youâ€™ll join us next year for the outing and dinner following.</p>
